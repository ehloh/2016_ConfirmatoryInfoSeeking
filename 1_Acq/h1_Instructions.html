    <h2>Technical difficulties</h2><br>

    We expect the vast majority of people (>90%) to complete the experiment without any problems. However, we've seen (in the past)
    that a small proportion of people do experience technical issues, <u>even though they
    are using the exact same website that has worked for other people</u>. Often, this is because of some browser/internet
    setting on their computer, that we have no control over. <br><br>

    If you do experience technical issues, don't spend more than 10 minutes trying to fix it. We won't be able to
    pay you the full amount for the HIT, but we will pay you for each session that you can show us
    that you've attempted to do. Information on how you get compensated in this situation, and what you should do if you
    encounter technical difficulties, is detailed <a target="_blank" href="acq0_Instructions.html" class="ErrorInfo">here</a>.

        Welcome to our experiment! Please read these instructions carefully, as they will help you perform the task better (and win more money in the game)<br><br>

        <h1><b>Learn to identify 'blaps'</b></h1><br>

        We are interested in how good you are at categorizing objects. In this experiment, you will see many pictures of objects, with different shapes and colors.

        Here are some examples:<br><br>
        <img src="Stim/Shape/practice_stim13.bmp" width="200px" height="200px"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="Stim/Shape/practice_stim8.bmp" width="80px" height="200px"><br><br>

        Your job is to learn how to recognize a certain type of object, called a ‘blap’. On each trial, the computer will
        show you a picture of an object, and will ask you whether you think that it is a blap or not.  <br><br>

        <b>There are certain rules that determine whether the object is likely to be a blap or not.</b><br><br>
        These rules only determine if the object is <u>likely</u> to be a blap, but they will not definitely tell you whether
        it is a blap or not. For example, the computer will never choose ‘sure thing’ rules, like ‘all shiny objects are
        blaps’. Instead, the computer will choose rules like ‘<i>most but not all</i> shiny objects are blaps’.<br><br>

        [ The ‘shiny objects’ is NOT the rule that is used in the experiment – it is just an example! ] <br><br>

        <h1><b>Learn from the feedback that the computer gives you</b></h1><br>

        After you make a guess, the computer will tell you whether you were correct or not. You can use that
        feedback to get better at the task. You might not know how to tell if an object is a blap or not, however,
        especially at the beginning of the session.<br><br>

        Try your best to learn what those rules are, so that you can get better at classifying the objects as time goes
        on. You will win more money in this experiment if you are good at recognizing when something is a blap or not!<br><br>

        <h1><b>How do I make my response?</b></h1><br>

        Press the <u>UP</u> arrow key for “yes” (if you think the object is a blap) or the <u>DOWN</u> arrow key for “no” (if you think
        the object is NOT a blap). You should use your RIGHT hand to make these responses<br><br>

        Let's just quickly practice that. Click the button below to start a practice.<br><br>
        <input type="button" onclick="presPracticeTrial()" value="Start Practice Session"><br><br>

<!-- ################################### LEARN ################################### -->
<div class="wrap_Learn" style="display:none">
    <div>

        Well done for completing the practice! This section of the experiment should take you between 0.5-1.5 hours to complete (depending
        on how well you do). You will get the opportunity to take breaks in between blocks

        <h1><b>Categorize objects alongside 4 other players</b></h1><br>

        During this next session, you will have to categorize more objects. You will be doing so alongside 4 other online players. <br><br>

        On every trial, you will first make a guess (about whether you think the object was a blap or not). Then, you will find out
        what one of the other players thought about the object - whether they thought it was a blap or not. Then, you will find out
        the true reality about whether the object was a blap or not. <br><br>

        <!--The 4 players you will be playing with are:<br><br>-->

        <!--<div class="i_source1" style="width: 150px; height:40px; position: absolute; left: 20%; transform: translate(-50%, 0%)"> <img src="Stim/src_bird.png" height='150px' width='150px' alt="bird"> </div>-->
        <!--<div class="i_source2" style="width: 150px; height:40px; position: absolute; left: 40%; transform: translate(-50%, 0%)"> <img src="Stim/src_cat.png" height='150px' width='150px' alt="cat"> </div>-->
        <!--<div class="i_source3" style="width: 150px; height:40px; position: absolute; left: 60%; transform: translate(-50%, 0%)"> <img src="Stim/src_elephant.png" height='150px' width='150px' alt="elephant"> </div>-->
        <!--<div class="i_source4" style="width: 150px; height:40px; position: absolute; left: 80%; transform: translate(-50%, 0%)"> <img src="Stim/src_fish.png" height='150px' width='150px' alt="fish"></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>-->

        This is what it will look like when someone gives you their guess about whether an object is a blap or not<br>
        <div style="background-color: rgb(150, 150, 150); width: 300px; height: 200px; position: relative; left: 50%; top: 0%; transform: translate(-50%, 0%)">
            <!--transform: translate(-50%, -50%)">-->
            <p><b><br>Is this a blap?</b></p>
            <img src="Stim/src_cat.png" height='100px' width='100px'>
            <div class="i_sourceInfo" style="background-color: rgb(227, 232, 227); line-height: 40px; width: 30px; height:30px; position: absolute; font-size: 0.8em; left: 50%; top: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, 0%)">No</div>
        </div><br><br>
        This means that this player thinks that the object is NOT a blap (the CAT might not be one of the player you are playing against, this picture is just an example)<br><br>


        The other players (who we'll call your 'sources') have the exact same information as you have, and will be doing their
        best to guess whether each object is a blap or not. None of them have ever seen the objects that you are going to see
        later on. <br><br>


        <h1><b>Try to learn what you think of the other players</b></h1><br>

        In the next stage of the experiment, you will have the opportunity to work together with the other players in the game. Thus, you should
        use this session to form an impression of the other players, so that you can use this knowledge later on. <br><br>


        The computer will tell you whether you were correct or not on every trial. This feedback relates to
        how YOU did, not the other player. Although you are not explicitly told whether the source was correct, you should be
        able to figure this out using the feedback, based on what you chose for that trial. You will win 100 points for every
        correct guess you make, and lose 100 points for every incorrect one. You should try your best to categorize each object
        accurately, as you will be paid a monetary bonus that is proportional to the total number of points that you win on the task.<br><br>

        <b>Knowing how good each of the others are at recognizing blaps will help you in the task later on.</b><br><br>

        Over the course of the experiment, you should try to figure out what you think of the 4 different sources
        (i.e. how similar they are to you in their judgments, and how accurate you think they are). While it is unlikely that anybody
        will be 100% correct, we expect some players to be better at this game than others. The 4 other sources are all likely
        to be different from each other in some ways, so try to notice what is unique about each player as you go along.<br><br>

        (Note: Try not to read too much into the animals that the other players have chosen to represent themseves in the game.
        The animal pictures will not have any influence on how well they will do at recognizing blaps.)<br><br>

        <h1><b>A few last things</b></h1><br>

        Try to make a quick guess about each object, rather than thinking for a long time about every new object.
        Generally, we find that people are just as good at identifying blaps if they rely on quick gut decisions. All the
        objects that you see in this session will be unique - you will never see the same object twice (even though some of the objects might look similar).

        <br><br>

        Every once in a while, the computer will also ask you about the trial you just finished - whether you had judged the
        object to be a blap or not, which source you heard from, or what the source  (the other player) said. The computer will show
        you a sentence describing one aspect of the trial you just finished, and you will have to judge whether
        the statement is true or false. <br><br>

        If you are paying attention, you should find this easy to do! Don't worry if you occasionally make mistakes,
        however. <br><br>

        Well done! This is the 2nd last session of the experiment. Please feel free to take a break now.<br><br>
        (We have set up the HIT so that you should have time for a bit of a break) <br><br>

        <h1><b>What do you think of the four players that you have been playing the game with?</b></h1><br>

        By now, you should have a good idea of how the four other players make decisions and how good they are at the task.<br><br>

        <b>Take a minute to think about the 4 other players<br><br></b>
        What do you think is unique about how each of them makes decisions?
        How would you describe each of the four others to someone else? Try to think about how they did over the
        entire session, not just in the last few trials. <br><br><br><br>
        <div class="i_source1" style="width: 150px; height:40px; position: absolute; left: 20%; transform: translate(-50%, 0%)"> <img src="Stim/src_bird.png" height='150px' width='150px' alt="bird"> </div>

        Take your time to decide what you think about each of the four other players - this will help you in this next session of
        the experiment. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h1><b>You can use information from the other players to win more on the task</b></h1><br>

        In this session, you will have to categorize more objects. Sometimes, you will get to use information from one of the
        other players to help you do the task.<br><br>

        Like before, you will see a picture of an object on every trial . All the objects will be new, and you will never see
        the same object twice. You will have to use the same keyboard buttons as before to tell the computer if you think the object is a blap or not. <br><br>

        On some trials (but not all of them), you will also get to hear from one of the other players.  The computer will show you
        2 players/sources that you may hear from on that trial. You will then have to choose ONE of them to hear from.
        <b>You should use what you know about the different players to make your decision.</b><br><br>

        This is what the screen will look like:<br><br>

        <div style="background-color: rgb(150, 150, 150); width: 300px; height: 200px; position: relative; left: 50%; top: 0%; transform: translate(-50%, 0%)">
            <p><b><br>Which player would you like to hear from?</b></p>
            <img src="Stim/src_cat.png" height='100px' width='100px' style="position: absolute; left: 30%; transform: translate(-50%, 0%)">
            <img src="Stim/src_bird.png" height='100px' width='100px' style="position: absolute; left: 70%; transform: translate(-50%, 0%)">
        </div><br><br>

        Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to tell the computer which player you’d like to hear from
        (the LEFT arrow for the left player, or the RIGHT arrow for the right player).<br><br>

        After you make your choice, that player’s guess will be shown to you. You will then have the opportunity to change
        your guess about whether you think the object is a blap or not. Unlike the previous session, you will NOT find out if
        you were correct on every trial. The computer will keep track of how you are doing, though. <b>Your second answer will
        also not be shown to the other players.</b> Only the computer will be keeping track of your final guesses.<br><br>



        <h1><b>Sometimes you will not get to get help from the other players</b></h1><br>

        Remember, you will not always get a chance to hear from the other players, or to make a second guess. For that reason,
        you should always try your best to make an accurate guess the first time around.<br><br>

        Like before, you will win 100 points for every correct guess you make, and lose 100 points for every incorrect one,
        and your overall accuracy will help determine how much of a bonus we will pay you.<br><br>

        The computer will also occasionally ask you about the trial you just completed, as in the previous session. These questions should
        be easy for you to answer, but don't worry if you occasionally make mistakes. <br><br>

        <h1><b>Let's check if you understand everything you need to know</b></h1><br>
