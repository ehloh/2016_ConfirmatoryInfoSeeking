This code is a sample of my Javascript pipeline, for collecting data online using Amazon Turk (written in Autumn 2016). 

Some of the JS code here has been scrambled in order to hide the design. This will be updated with the correct design algorithm once the paper is published.  

For convenience, data is posted via PHP via a text string (using JSON library). The analysis folder contains a data parser to import the data into MATLAB.
